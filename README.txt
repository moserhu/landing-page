This is my first attempt at creating a landing page. At first
I was incredibly overwhelmed and needed to take a couple days 
break after I slaughtered my first run at it.
After sitting down and watching a few more tutorials (in
addtion to the Odin Project lesson plan I was follwoing) I was 
delighted how quickly I started to get the hang of things.

I'm excited to see how much further I can grow!
